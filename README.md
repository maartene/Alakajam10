# Alakajam10
Entry for the 10th Alakajam

## Limitations
* NO PERSISTENCE: application goes down, all data/progress is lost
* To mitigate this time moves a lot faster (you should be able to win before MTBF kicks in)

## Tech stuff
* Application based on [Vapor 4](https://vapor.codes) (a server-side Swift framework for developing API's and fullstack applications)
* Logo using Logoist 3
* Docker image deployed to Digital Ocean
* Find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/maartene/Alakajam10)
