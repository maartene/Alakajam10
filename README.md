# MOVE ZIG!
## Entry for the 10th Alakajam
SPACE is a great place to RACE! So that's what we'll do. Customize your ship focussing on offense (pew pew), defence or speed.

Be careful: after the first stint, you can meet adversaries (you can SCAN for other players). And the further you get, the bigger the chance of encounters. If you lose all your armor, you will need to try again.

### [Playable build here](https://movezig-tvzsv.ondigitalocean.app)
(The built will only be available a couple of weeks)

## Limitations
* NO PERSISTENCE: application goes down, all data/progress is lost
* To mitigate this time moves a lot faster (you should be able to win before MTBF kicks in)
* No victory screen yet...

## Tech stuff
* Application based on [Vapor 4](https://vapor.codes) (a server-side Swift framework for developing API's and fullstack applications)
* Logo using Logoist 3
* Docker image deployed to Digital Ocean
* Find the source on [GitHub](https://github.com/maartene/Alakajam10)
